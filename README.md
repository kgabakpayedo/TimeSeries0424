# Time series project : April 2024

## This school project accounts for the linear time series course, second-year engineering course at ENSAE Paris. The main goal is to model and predict an observed time series of the French economy. Using the French Industrial Production Index from the INSEE's series databank, we fit an ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model to the series of the monthly motor vehicule manufacturing index from January 1990 to December 2018. More details about the index can be found at : .

The "data" file contains the series table in csv and xlsx formats 
The "scripts" contains the R script we use for the analysis
